15,2024-07-24,honestly i think so a lot of the papers use older models 3.5 last year instead of because the cost difference is bigger than the performance and not measuring performance benchmarks also only probably looking to use it for in 1 algorithm for so it will be such a small portion of the paper and i am pretty sure the cost difference between even the llama 3 vs was quite large right so assume the new one would be a price jump too i will send her a thank you the lab computer is very limited though we could only actually get the one to run we have enough for the most advanced one perfect thank if the new llama has a small version that is the same size but trained differently than the old we can download that one but i think for the big versions of any of them we need 8 and we have 1 for the actual when testing i can try both versions and see if there is a difference too where they request items to be printed also is asking if we can test on his slack which is very we also are hopefully super close to getting the so maybe we can implement that too so we have 3 graphs really populating and can test altogether okay i looked at the word sorry i think in the chi paper and found that alone it really a sign of admitting to mistakes is what i was looking it a sign of admitting to important mistakes that would help to build it was more like ill be 10 min i echo that some summary statistics of sentiment across teams might be because we have data to compare slack vs in but is there variation across does that kind of align with what you saw in the,UV3RGDHFF,CDW73QUAU,slack_design_data
